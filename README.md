### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer engineering student with a passion for app development. With three years of experience under my belt, I have been fortunate enough to work on a variety of Android projects that have allowed me to hone my skills in Java, Kotlin, and C++. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly applications that not only meet the needs of the users but also push the boundaries of what is possible. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and that is why I am committed to creating inclusive and intuitive software. Thank you for stopping by my GitHub profile, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
